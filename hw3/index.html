    <h1> Homework 3</h1>
    <p> This is a <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/80526/FoodEnvironmentAtlas.zip?v=9648.4">link</a> to the Food Environment Atlas. The objectives of the Food Environment Atlas are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a community's ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so. The CSV contains data from 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017.</p>
